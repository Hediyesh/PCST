# PCST
A Flask application for Prize Collecting Steiner Tree for a complete graph with 4 vertices
Flask is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file.
The Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding a tree in a graph that connects a subset of specified vertices while minimizing the total cost of edges and maximizing the collected prizes associated with the vertices. In other words, it combines both the Steiner Tree problem and a prize-collecting objective.
Here is the Flask app for PCST for a complete graph with 4 vertices.
app.py contains the calculation and selection of the best path.
index.html contains html code for input.
result.html shows the graph and cost and penalty of the best path.
